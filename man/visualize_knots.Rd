\title{Visualize Knots and Coverage of Wendland Basis Functions}
\usage{
visualize_knots(knots, stations, r, W, select = c(1, 12, 10))
}
\arguments{
\item{knots}{A dataframe or matrix with coordinates of knots (must have columns \code{x} and \code{y}).}

\item{stations}{A dataframe or matrix with coordinates of stations (must have columns \code{x} and \code{y}).}

\item{r}{A numeric scalar specifying the radius of influence for the Wendland basis functions.}

\item{W}{A matrix of weights from the Wendland basis functions. Rows correspond to stations, and
columns correspond to knots.}

\item{select}{A numeric vector of indices specifying the knots whose coverage regions will be
visualized. Defaults to \code{c(1, 12, 10)}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object that visualizes:
\itemize{
\item Knots as red '+' markers.
\item Coverage regions as circles around the knots.
\item Stations influenced by selected knots in different colors (e.g., blue, green, yellow).
\item Stations not covered by any knot (with \code{NA} weights) in black.
}
}
\description{
This function visualizes the spatial coverage of Wendland basis functions for selected knots.
It highlights the knots, their coverage regions, and stations influenced by selected knots.
}
\details{
The function generates circular paths representing the coverage of each knot. It then
visualizes the stations influenced by specific knots with a customizable color scheme.

\examples{
# Example data
knots <- data.frame(x = runif(20, 0, 10), y = runif(20, 0, 10))
stations <- data.frame(x = runif(100, 0, 10), y = runif(100, 0, 10))
r <- 2
W <- matrix(runif(2000, 0, 1), nrow = 100, ncol = 20)

# Visualize the coverage
visualize_knots(knots, stations, r, W, select = c(1, 5, 10))
